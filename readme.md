##Comments
Comments are notes on how to solve the problem. What to search, links explaining pieces of what we need to know to solve the problem.  

##Refactorings 

Commits start with problem descriptions, with notes explaining how to solve it. Then a sloppy/brute force solution. Then refactorings.
